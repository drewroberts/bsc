# Blockchain Smart Contracts
by DrewRoberts.eth & BrielleDurrant.eth

The [first chapter](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/1.md) will simply be What are Smart Contracts? and will cover basic information about them & the benefits over traditional contracts.

[2nd chapter](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/2.md) provides an overview of Blockchain Technology & how distributed systems work & why smart contracts are superior to centralized code bases.

[Chapter 3](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/3.md) outlines types of smart contracts and overall concepts for understanding how they operate along with token accounts. Need to also provide a brief history of the standards used on Ethereum.

[Chapter 4](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/4.md) dives into the different blockchains in 2024 and the benefits each ecosystem has for certain types of smart contracts & why it's important to be omnichain. Also discusses the nuanced approach used by various chains on tokens.

[Chapter 5](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/5.md) could go into fungible and non fungible tokens and their corresponding smart contracts along with information about token gating communities and the benefits that brings.

[Chapter 6](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/6.md) dives into liquidity pools and exotic pairings used with fungible tokens.

[Chapter 7](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/7.md) would cover wrapping tokens or other assets along with cross chaining tokens.

[Chapter 8](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/8.md) would dive into oracles & using external data.

[Chapter 9](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/9.md) covers the alternative approach of ordinals & ethscriptions.

[Chapter 10](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/x10.md) will dive into vesting tokens and other compensation contract structures like splitters & buy/sell bots, etc.

[Chapter 11](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/x11.md) could be mev bots (arbitrage), sniper bots, and sandwich bots plus other automation solutions.

[Chapter 12](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/x12.md) would pull back the hood of decentralized exchanges & the bonding curves and other concepts that make those smart contracts possible especially with Uniswap V3 NFT model for liquidity pools.

[Chapter 13](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/x13.md) would cover contract standards & ERC and EIP procedures for approval by the foundation.

[Chapter 14](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/x14.md) needs to cover wallet drainers along with malicious functions to look out for in smart contracts.

[Chapter 15](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/x15.md) would cover where things are heading and some of the token bound accounts & other things on the horizon.

[Chapter 16](https://github.com/drewroberts/bsc/blob/main/chapters/x16.md) would discuss the intersection of AI and blockchain and the experimentation & potential of that as it relates to smart contracts.
